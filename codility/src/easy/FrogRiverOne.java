     * . A small frog wants to get to the other side of a river. The frog is
     * initially located on one bank of the river (position 0) and wants to get
     * to the opposite bank (position X+1). Leaves fall from a tree onto the
     * surface of the river.
     *
     * You are given an array A consisting of N integers representing the
     * falling leaves. A[K] represents the position where one leaf falls at time
     * K, measured in seconds. The goal is to find the earliest time when the
     * frog can jump to the other side of the river. The frog can cross only
     * when leaves appear at every position across the river from 1 to X (that
     * is, we want to find the earliest moment when all the positions from < 1 to X
     * > are covered by leaves). You may assume that the speed of the current in
     * the river is negligibly small, i.e. the leaves do not change their
     * positions once they fall in the river.
     *
     * Given a non-empty array A consisting of N integers and integer X, returns
     * the earliest time when the frog can jump to the other side of the river.
     *
     * If the frog is never able to jump to the other side of the river, the
     * function should return âˆ’1.
