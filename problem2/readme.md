### Problem Two: Conference Track Management
 
You are planning a big programming conference and have received many proposals which have passed the initial screen process but you're having trouble fitting them into the time constraints of the day -- there are so many possibilities! So you write a program to do it for you.
- The conference has multiple tracks each of which has a morning and afternoon session.
- Each session contains multiple talks.
- Morning sessions begin at 9am and must finish by 12 noon, for lunch.
- Afternoon sessions begin at 1pm and must finish in time for the networking event.
- The networking event can start no earlier than 4:00 and no later than 5:00.
- No talk title has numbers in it.
- All talk lengths are either in minutes (not hours) or lightning (5 minutes).
- Presenters will be very punctual; there needs to be no gap between talks.

### Sequence Diagram for Event.scheduleMustFinsihByNoon
Morning session schedule sorted to finished by noon, for lunch.

### ScreenShot
![image](src/main/resources/img/210527TrackMngt.png)

This application outputs with three different schedules, ie 
* Unsorted Schedule,
* Evenly distributed to sessions Schedule, and
* Finished-by-Noon schedule. 

### JUnit Test
Application execute by run the *test* with data.

Data, outputs shown at [`test/.../Problem2ApplicationTests.java`](/problem2/src/test/java/problem2/Problem2ApplicationTests.java).

---
### Problem2ApplicationTests.java
``` java
	@Test
	public void prinInput() {
		prinInput(talks());

		var event = new Event(talks());
		
		System.out.println("\n*** Schedule Unsort ***");
		event.scheduleUnsortedOutput();

		System.out.println("\n*** Schedule Rotate Distributing ***");
		event = new Event(talks());
		event.scheduleRotateOutput();
		
		System.out.println("\n*** Schedule MustFinishedByNoon ***");
		event = new Event(talks());
		event.scheduleMustFinishedByNoon();	
		
		System.out.println("");
	}
	
	private static ArrayList<Talk> talks() {
		Talk[] talkArray = {
				new Talk( "Writing Fast Tests Against Enterprise Rails 60min", 60 ),
				new Talk( "Overdoing it in Python 45min",45 ),
				...
```
The following are three class objects for Finished-By-Noon output:
### Event.java
``` java
public class Event {
	private static ArrayList<Talk> talks;
	
	public Event(ArrayList<Talk> talks) {
		super();
		Event.talks = talks;
	}
	...
	/* MustFinishedByNoon output */
	public void scheduleMustFinishedByNoon() {

		Track trackList = new Track(talks);
		ArrayList<Track> allTracks = trackList.iniTrack();
		
		var sessSorting = new Session(talks);
		
		// sort on morning session, must before noon
		for (var tk: allTracks) {
			Session sessAm = tk.getAm();
			sessAm = sessSorting.selectionSort(sessSorting.getTalks(), sessAm);
			tk.setAm(sessAm);
		}
		
		// sort on afternoon session
		for (var tk: allTracks) {
			Session sessPm = tk.getPm();
			sessPm = sessSorting.selectionSort(sessSorting.getTalks(), sessPm);
			tk.setPm(sessPm);
		}	
		
		addLunchNetwork(allTracks);
		printout(allTracks);
	}
```
### Track.java
``` java
public class Track {
	private int TrackNo;
	private Session am;
	private Session pm;
	private ArrayList<Talk> talks;
	public Track() {
		super();
	}
	public Track(ArrayList<Talk> talks) {
		super();
		this.talks = talks;
	}
	...
	/* Instantiate Track and Sessions */
	public ArrayList<Track> iniTrack() {
		var allTracks = new ArrayList<Track>();
		for (var i = 1 ; i <= noOfTrack() ; i++) {
			var t = new Track();
			t.setTrack();
			t.setTrackNo(i);
			allTracks.add(t);
		}
		return allTracks;
	}
```
### Session.java
``` java
public class Session {

	private LocalDateTime startTime;
	private int duration;
	private ArrayList<Talk> talks;
	
	public Session() {
		super();
	}
	public Session(ArrayList<Talk> talks) {
		super();
		this.talks = talks;
	}
	...
	/* for MustFinishedByNoon, using Selection Sort */ 
	public Session selectionSort(ArrayList<Talk> tk, Session sess) {
		var balTalks = new ArrayList<Talk>();
		var temp = new ArrayList<Talk>();
		var sessTalks = sess.getTalks();
		int sessDura = sess.getDuration();
		
		do {
			sessTalks.clear();
			temp.clear();
			
			for (var t : tk) {
				if ((sess.getTotalTime() + t.getMins() ) <= sessDura) {
					sessTalks.add(t);}
				else temp.add(t);
			}
			
			if ((sess.getTotalTime() != sessDura) && (temp.size() > 0) ) {
				balTalks.add(tk.get(0));
				tk.remove(0);
			}
		} while ((sess.getTotalTime() != sessDura) && (temp.size() > 0) );
		
		for (var t : temp) {
			balTalks.add(t);
		}
		
		setTalks(balTalks);
		return sess;
	}	
```
